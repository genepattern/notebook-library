<h3>Using the GenePattern Notebook Environment</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Jupyter is a community of data enthusiasts who believe in the power of open tools and standards for education,
    research, and data analytics. We welcome contributions and contributors of all kinds - whether they come as
    contributions to code, participation in the community, opening issues and pointing out bugs, or simply sharing your
    work with your colleagues and friends.</p>
<h2 id="join-the-jupyter-community">Join the Jupyter community</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in joining the Jupyter community (yay!) we recommend checking out the
    Jupyter<span>&nbsp;</span><a
        href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor/content-contributor.html">Contributing guide</a>.
    This contains information about the different projects in the Jupyter ecosystem, the tools and skills that are
    useful for each project, and other ways that you can become a part of the Jupyter community.</p>
<h3 id="jupyterdays-jupytercon-and-other-events">JupyterDays, JupyterCon, and other events</h3>
<p>Many members of the Jupyter community host events to connect others that use Jupyter and other tools in the open data
    analytics stack. For example,<span>&nbsp;</span><a
        href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny">JupyterCon</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is an annual conference
    that brings together many different groups represented in the Jupyter Community.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Jupyter
        Days</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>are smaller, locally-organized events for learning and connecting with one
    another. For example,<span>&nbsp;</span><a
        href="https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-jupyter-day-atlanta-spring-2018-d68ebee2c6cb">here&rsquo;s a post
        announcing Jupyter Days in Atlanta</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to organize a Jupyter Days event in your community,
    please reach out!</p>
<h2 id="participate-online">Participate online</h2>
<p>Jupyter also has a number of online communication channels to help keep in touch.</p>
<p>As you interact with others in the Jupyter ecosystem, remember that we have a strong commitment to being
    an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>open, inclusive, and positive community</strong>. Please read the<span>&nbsp;</span><a
        href="https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md">Jupyter Code of
        Conduct</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community
    thrive.</p>
<p>Below is a short list of gitter channels, email listservs, and github repositories where you can get
    involved.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>We always welcome participation in the Jupyter community</strong>.</p>

    security reports, you can use<span>&nbsp;</span><a
